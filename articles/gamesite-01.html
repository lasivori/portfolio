			<h4>Idea</h4>
			<p>&emsp;The plan is to create a web app that allows small/indie game developers to upload their games for others to access them, as well as a place for gamers to talk on forums, give game reviews, and possibly even post videos of gameplay.</p>
			<p>&emsp;Why do I want this? Honestly, I just wanted more options for small game developers to share their games for free. I will create more blog posts as I create this project, explaining my process, and also updating anyone on my plans. There is a good possibility of adding more features as I go on and think of them.</p>
			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>&emsp;In more detail, let’s start with the main feature: I would want users to be able to upload and download games that they or others have made. Of course, as a proof of concept, I cannot allow files that are too large, as I don’t have access to servers that would support this. Within these “game pages”, users should be able to post reviews of the game. I would also want users to be able to create their own forums and posts within those forums in order to discuss topics that they’d like to.</p>
			<p>&emsp;Beyond this, features that I’d like to add but I’m not too sure on yet are allowing users to post videos (possibly having a seperate section of the website for this, instead of mixing it in with the forums). Also, if possible, I’d like to have a way for reviews to have a “verification” where it shows if the user that left a review has actually downloaded the game. For the frontend requirements, of course we will be using HTML, and I’ll be using Bootstrap to make things look nice. JavaScript will be used for the videoplayer if that is done, and it may be used to make the website flow well. For the backend requirements, I’m honestly not too sure of all the requirements yet, but I do know I’ll need a server to host files on, as well as possibly using a database.</p>
			<h4>Planned Features</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Create Account</li>
				<li>Upload and Download Games</li>
				<li>Create Forums and Posts within those forums</li>
				<li>Post Reviews within Game Download Pages</li>
